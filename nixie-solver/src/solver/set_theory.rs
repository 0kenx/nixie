//! Finite sets: the defining axioms, generated at assert time.
//!
//! # Where this sits
//!
//! CVC5 solves finite sets *lazily* (`src/theory/sets`): an equality engine
//! over set terms plus membership facts, with `checkDownwardsClosure`,
//! `checkUpwardsClosure` and `checkDisequalities` run to a fixpoint, and
//! cardinality in a module of its own. It also has `set_reduction.cpp`, which
//! reduces some set constructs to definitions up front.
//!
//! This is the reduction, done for the whole quantifier-free fragment. Every
//! membership atom the problem can reach is given its defining clauses when
//! the assertion is encoded, so the SAT layer and EUF decide sets without a
//! mid-search propagator. The reason is not simplicity: a theory solver here
//! holds only `&TermManager` during search and cannot create the membership
//! atoms or disequality witnesses it would need — the same constraint that
//! makes `ArrayTheory` pre-create its extensionality witnesses at encode time.
//!
//! # The axioms
//!
//! For an element `e` and each shape of set, the membership atom is *defined*:
//!
//! ```text
//! e in (as set.empty T)   <=>  false
//! e in (set.singleton y)  <=>  e = y
//! e in (set.union a b)    <=>  e in a  \/  e in b
//! e in (set.inter a b)    <=>  e in a  /\  e in b
//! e in (set.minus a b)    <=>  e in a  /\  ~(e in b)
//! ```
//!
//! and the two relations between whole sets are decided by their members:
//!
//! ```text
//! (set.subset a b)  =>  (e in a => e in b)          for every element e
//! ~(set.subset a b) =>  k in a /\ ~(k in b)         for a fresh witness k
//! (= a b)           =>  (e in a <=> e in b)         for every element e
//! ~(= a b)          =>  (k in a) xor (k in b)       for a fresh witness k
//! ```
//!
//! The witness is what makes **extensionality** decidable: two sets that are
//! not equal must differ *somewhere*, and naming that place is the only way to
//! turn a disequality into something the rest of the solver can use. It is the
//! same move as `ArrayTheory`'s extensionality witness, and as CVC5's
//! `checkDisequalities`.
//!
//! # What is not covered
//!
//! `set.card`. Cardinality couples set structure to integer arithmetic — it is
//! why CVC5 gives it a separate Venn-region module — and it is not reduced
//! here. A problem containing `set.card` keeps
//! [`Solver::set_terms_unconstrained`](super::Solver), so its `Sat` degrades
//! to `Unknown` rather than resting on an unconstrained integer.
